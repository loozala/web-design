        <h1>BTS</h1>
        <p>The septet's name, BTS, stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan.<br>
            According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms,<br>
             and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".In 2020, BTS became one of the few groups since the <br>
             Beatles (1966â€“68) to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years,<br>
              with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year,
            <br> they also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard<br>
             Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite"</p>
