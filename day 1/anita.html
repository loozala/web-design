            <h1> Air Pollution</h1>
            <p><strong>Air pollution</p></strong> is  contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, 
            physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.
                Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.
                WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. 
                Air quality is closely linked to the earths climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, 
                lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.

                <h3>preventive measure of air pollution type</h3>

                <ol> 
                <li>Reduce the number of trips you take in your car.</li>
                <li>Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use.</li>
                <li>Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.</li>
                <li>Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.</li>
            </ol>

                <h1>12<sup>th</sup>december 2022</h1>
                <p><i>Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death,[5][12] with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million.<br> Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world's largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.<br> The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: 90% of the world's population breathes dirty air to some degree. Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.</p></i>
