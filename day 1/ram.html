        <h2> <b><u>CLIMATE CHANGE</b></u></h2>
        <p> Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, 
            but since the 1800s, <br>human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing 
            climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.</p>\
            <h2>CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
        <ol> 
        <li>generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes climate change</li>
        <li>running of vehicles also causes climate change </li>
        <li>high number of production of food increases climate change.</li>
        <li>increasing amount of pollution in daily basis are causing harm to the climate.</li>
    </ol>
